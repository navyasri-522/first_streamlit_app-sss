Imagine if a Snowflake table is suddenly dropped. Can you determine who dropped it and when?

Let's say you need to generate a global view by performing union operations on 15 to 20 views. 
There is a column in every view that identifies the source table. The global view will retrieve data from
the underlying table when you query it for a specific source. 
However, if you retrieve data from a global view for two sources, 
will the view scan the micro partitions of all 20 tables or just the micro partitions of those two sources?
